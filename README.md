Here we have examined how two different commodities, oil and gold, performed over the past 5 years. We looked at price, volume traded, and overall volatitlity of each in order to establish a correlation between the two. 

# How have the prices of Oil and Gold changed over the past 5 years?
  The price of both Oil and Gold have both increased throughout the time period we examined. Gold was traded at a much higher, more inconsistent rate and saw prices almost double from 2018 to 2023. Oil was traded a bit more consistently, and at a much lower price point but still saw an overall increase in price.

# When did each commodity experience the highest trading volumes? 
  Gold saw the highest trading volume in the second quarter of 2020. Oil saw the highest trading volume in the first quarter of 2022.

# How does the volatility of prices compare and what is the correlation between Oil and Gold?
  Over the past 5 years, Oil had an average price of $63.39 per Barrel with the 25% quartile at $53 and the 75% quartile at almost $75 per barrel. Gold on the other hand had an average price of $1,724 per ounce with the 25% quartile at $1,336 and the 75% quartile of 1,819 per ounce. While there were no outliers for Gold, there were a total of 67 outliers within the Oil price data. Even when removing outliers, there is a weak but positive correlation between the prices of Oil and Gold. Both are very different commodities, used for very different things but ultimately impacted by the state of the economy.

# What is the effect of prices on volumes traded? 
  There is weak inverse relation between the price of gold and volume . As prices increase, volume decreases because less people can afford to trade, the commodity becomes more valuable, and people tend to hold onto their investments. The R-squared value which is 0.053 very weak linear correlation between them.
