Here we have examined how two different commodities, oil and gold, performed over the past 5 years in the stock market. We looked at price, volume traded, and overall volatitlity of each in order to establish a correlation between the two. 

# How have the prices of Oil and Gold changed over the past 5 years?
  The price of both Oil and Gold have both increased throughout the time period we examined. Gold was traded at a much higher, more inconsistent rate and saw prices almost double from 2018 to 2023. Oil was traded a bit more consistently, and at a much lower price point but still saw an overall increase in price.

# When did each commodity experience the highest trading volumes? 
  Gold Price and Volume
  
Gold saw its highest trading volume in the third quarter of 2019 as the world started seeing the effects of COVID in China, increasing people's uncertainty for the future and causing a change towards safer assets like gold commodity. It's second highest peak is on the third quarter of 2020 and has since been followed by a decrease of volume, this can be due to the increase in price of gold commodity since 2020 Q3.

  Oil Price and Volume
  
Oil commodity was mostly traded in the first quarter of 2020 and saw great decrease the following years while its price greatly increased. The price of Oil greatly decreased in 2020 due to COVID lockdowns around the world however volume of oil commodity didn't increase during this year. During and after 2021 the price of oil has increased while its volume has kept decreasing until today.

# How does the volatility of prices compare and what is the correlation between Oil and Gold?
  Over the past 5 years, Oil had an average price of $63.39 per Barrel with the 25% quartile at $53 and the 75% quartile at almost $75 per barrel. Gold on the other hand had an average price of $1,724 per ounce with the 25% quartile at $1,336 and the 75% quartile of 1,819 per ounce. While there were no outliers for Gold, there were a total of 67 outliers within the Oil price data. Even when removing outliers, there is a weak but positive correlation between the prices of Oil and Gold. Both are very different commodities, used for very different things but ultimately impacted by the state of the economy.

  We found there is a very weak but positive correlation between the prices of Oil and Gold. Both are very different commodities, used for very different things but ultimately impacted by the state of the economy. We can also see from the low R-Squared of 0.014 that there is a weak linear relationship between the two data sets.

  We also analyzed the relationship between the volumes of gold and oil traded over time. We have a stronger but still weak positive correlation between the two sets of volumes at 0.21. Additionally, the R-squared has improved slightly, but not meaningfully to 0.045 indicating the regression line does not fit the data well. Given these two commodities are used by different consumers for unrelated reasons, this makes sense as the main driving force of volumes traded that they share is strength of the overall market.

# What is the effect of prices on volumes traded? 
  There is weak inverse relation between the price of gold and volume . As prices increase, volume decreases because less people can afford to trade, the commodity becomes more valuable, and people tend to hold onto their investments. The R-squared value which is 0.053 very weak linear correlation between them.
